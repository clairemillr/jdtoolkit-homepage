<p class="hello"> Hello and welcome to my webpage!</p>

		<p> <a href="images.html">This is the first link that you should checkout!</a> Everything linked was an assignment for my Journalism and Design class at the new school.</p>

		<p>Welcome to my website! Here you will find a bunch of random things. Maybe a <a href="flyer.html">flyer</a> to a fake event that could totally be real, and if was it would be way too much fun to handle.</p>
