<p> Hello and welcome to my documentation of what I've been doing during quarantine.</p>

		<p> This is my cat, Blu. He is an indoor cat because he doesn't know how to act when he is outside. However, because I've been so bored at home I've been putting him in his little harness and taking him outside. ALL THE TIME! As you can see in this video, Blue is really happy to be outside!.</p>

		<p> If you want a list of things you can do during quarantine go back to my main <a href="index.html">webpage!</a></p>
